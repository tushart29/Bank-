# Bank-

This lab will serve a few purposes. First, it will provide hands-on experience using both queues
and binary search trees. It will also provide an opportunity for further program/class design as
the project does not specifically delineate class structure or design.
There are aspects of the spec below which allow interpretation—please read/design and ask
questions early to clarify any ambiguity.
A peer design review will be required to help with the latter aspect. This design review will
require a deliverable to canvas and will be part of the final grade for the lab.
Problem Overview:
You will build a banking application which processes transactions. This banking
application consists of three phases.
1) The program will read in a string of transactions from a file into an in-memory queue.
These transactions can open accounts, withdraw funds, deposit funds, transfer funds, or ask for
the transactional history to be printed.
2) The program will next read from the queue and process the transactions in order.
3) When the queue has been depleted the program will print out all open accounts and
balances in those accounts.
Details:
Input:
To test your program a file will be passed in by argument to the program on the
command line. The file will contain a list of transactions that need to be executed.
Transactions of the format described below (see section on transactions) will be contained in
this file. There will be one transaction per line.
Assume that the input is well-formed in the file—that is, there are no syntax errors.
That said, there may be errors in the transactions themselves. For instance, a transaction may
try to withdraw more money than there is a fund or try to withdraw for a non-existent fund.
See the section below entitled errors for details.
Client Accounts and Funds:
Each client account contains assets held in up to eight funds. A client account is
represented by a first and last name (two strings) and a unique id (integer).
The eight funds that each account have are as follows:
0: Money Market 5: Capital Value Fund
1: Prime Money Market 6: Growth Equity Fund
2: Long-Term Bond 7: Growth Index Fund
3: Short-Term Bond
4: 500 Index Fund
All client accounts are opened with an open transaction, O (see below).
Transactions:
There are five types of transactions and each are identified by a character beginning the line.
O: Open a client account and instantiate eight funds with 0 assets each
D: Deposit assets into a fund
W: Withdraw assets from a fund
T: Transfer assets between funds (can be funds owned by a single client or
transfers between clients)
A: Display the history of all transactions for a client account
F: Display the history for all transactions of a given fund
The format for the commands consists of a transaction type (above), followed by an account id,
fund id, and amount. For transfers the from account and fund comes before to account and
fund.
Examples:
D 1234 1 100 Deposit $100 into the prime money market account of client ID 1234
W 1234 0 500 Withdraw $500 from the money market of client ID 1234.
T 1234 0 1234 1 1000 Transfer $1000 from client 1234's money market to the prime money market.
T 1234 0 5678 0 1000 Transfer $1000 from 1234's money market to 5678's money market.
A 1234 Display the history of all transactions of all accounts for client 1234.
F 1234 4 Display the history for all transactions on the 500 Index Fund for client 1234
O 6537 Bowden Charles Open an account for client Charles Bowden. Use account id 6537.
Errors:
As noted above, assume the format (number and types of input items) are correct. However,
the program should deal with all other types semantic errors. For instance, there could be a
bad account number (for instance, one already used) or an amount which is too much to
withdraw. Also, assume that each line will begin with an appropriate letter: O, W, D, T, A, and
F.
Examples of errors which may occur:
W 6543 6 10000 (when the Gowth Equity fund of client 6543 has only $20)
D 7654 76 1000
A transaction that would cause a balance to become negative should not occur and is an error
(A withdrawal or transfer of $0 is fine). There is one exception to this rule: if you are
withdrawing from a money market fund with insufficient dollars, and it can be covered with
dollars from the other money market fund owned by the client account, the desired amount
(only the partial amount needed to cover the withdrawal) is moved to that money market
account. The two Bond accounts are handled similarly. If one is transferring between two
linked funds (say, 0 and 1) then the transaction should only succeed if the fund being
withdrawn from has enough funds. No other types of accounts are handled in this manner.
Appropriate error messages should be printed out to cerr. No other messages should be
printed out during phase 1 or phase 2.
Output:
In Phase 3, each client account will be printed out with the amount held in each
account. Please make sure to create an intuitive and readable output for this aspect of the
program. This should be part of the design.
Data Structures:
One key aspect of this Lab exercise is the right class design for handling the problem. So
in general there is no pre-defined classes or signature structure for the classes required. The
suggestion is to keep the balances as ints (doubles or floats are not required). This is up to you
to define. However, there are two data structures which are required.
First, you need to use a queue to read the transactions into during phase 1. All
transactions should be read before processing starts. The queue can be the STL queue.
Second, the client accounts should be stored in a binary search tree (BSTree). Please
note that for the design phase of the assignment you can assume the BSTree is just a container
with functions like Retrieve, Insert, and Empty.
